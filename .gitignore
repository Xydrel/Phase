# NOTE:
#  Paths that start with / match paths relative to the root (where the .gitignore file is)
#  Paths that end with / will match a folder and all files under it (but not a regular file with no extension)
#  Use * for wildcards.  Wildcards stop at path separators
#  Use ** for a wildcard that spans path separators
#  Paths in this file should use forward slash characters, not back slashes
#  Use \ to escape special characters like ! and #
#  Use ! to negate a previous pattern.  But it doesn't work if the parent sub-folder was masked out already.
